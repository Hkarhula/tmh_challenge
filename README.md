# tmh_challenge

In this file I shall keep a running commentary of my approach.
Usually I don't keep this kind of file, but I believe this will provide valuable insight to my approach that is likely to go unnoticed otherwise.

## (Planned) Steps

1. create git repo, done
2. document initial thoughts
3. work on the challenge
4. code documentation
5. document closing thoughts
